If everything is urgent, nothing is. Here's a fast path to higher signal alerts.

## What happened
This update is relevant to teams that ship and operate modern apps. Even if it looks “small”, changes like this often cascade into:
- new attack paths
- changed defaults
- new patches to apply
- updated detection rules

## Why it matters
The real risk is rarely the headline—it’s the *gap* between:
- when the issue is publicly known, and
- when your environment is actually patched / protected.

If your stack touches **Alert Fatigue: How to Tune for Signal**, treat it as a prompt to review exposure, telemetry, and patch hygiene.

## What to do this week
1. **Inventory**
   - Identify where this component exists (prod, staging, CI, dev laptops).
2. **Patch / mitigate**
   - Apply vendor guidance where available.
   - If patching is slow, add compensating controls (WAF rules, allowlists, rate limits).
3. **Detection**
   - Look for unusual auth attempts, spikes in errors, or abnormal outbound traffic.
4. **Communicate**
   - Document status: “affected?”, “patched?”, “monitoring in place?”

## Quick checklist
- [ ] Confirm versions in production
- [ ] Apply fixes or mitigations
- [ ] Validate with a small test (health check, smoke test)
- [ ] Add a short incident note (what would we alert on?)
